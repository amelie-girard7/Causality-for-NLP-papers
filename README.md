# Causality For NLP
In this repository, I will explore the publicly available Data and Gaps in studying the intersestion between NLP and Causal inference.


## Causality to Improve NLP: Causal interpretations and explanations

| Title | Description | Code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Towards Trustworthy Explanation: On Causal Rationalization** | Wenbo Zhang, Tong Wu, Yunlong Wang, Yong Cai, Hengrui Cai - This paper utilizes probability of causation to improve NLP self-explaining models. | https://github.com/onepounchman/Causal-Retionalization |
| **CausaLM: Causal Model Explanation Through Counterfactual Language Models** | Amir Feder, Nadav Oved, Uri Shalit and Roi Reichart - Suggested a method for generating causal explanations through counterfactual language representations. | https://github.com/amirfeder/CausaLM |
| **Causal Mediation Analysis for Interpreting Neural NLP: The Case of Gender Bias** | Jesse Vig, Sebastian Gehrmann, Yonatan Belinkov, Sharon Qian, Daniel Nevo, Yaron Singer and Stuart Shieber - Uses causal mediation analysis to interpret NLP models. | https://github.com/sebastianGehrmann/CausalMediationAnalysis |
| **Causal BERT: Language Models for Causality Detection Between Events Expressed in Text** | Vivek Khetan, Roshni Ramnani, Mayuresh Anand, Subhashis Sengupta, Andrew E. Fano - This paper investigates the language model’s capabilities for identification of causal association among events expressed in natural language text using only the sentence context, sentence context combined with event information, and by leveraging masked event context with in-domain and out-of-domain data distribution. | https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05453.pdf |

### Causal Inference in Natural Language Processing: Estimation, Prediction, Interpretation and Beyond
(arXiv:2109.00725)


The paper is a comprehensive survey that addresses the application of causal inference in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP)¹. Here's a summary of its key points:

**Importance of Causality in NLP**: The paper highlights that while causality plays a critical role in social sciences, it has not been as prominent in NLP, which has traditionally focused more on predictive tasks.

**Emerging Interdisciplinary Research**: There is an emerging area of research that combines causal inference and language processing. This interdisciplinary approach is beginning to gain traction within the NLP community.

**Research Consolidation**: The authors consolidate research from various academic domains to provide a unified overview of causal inference in NLP. They discuss the unique challenges and opportunities that textual data presents for causal analysis.

**Statistical Challenges**: The paper introduces the statistical challenge of estimating causal effects with text, including scenarios where text is used as an outcome, treatment, or to address confounding factors.

**Improving NLP Models**: The authors explore how causal inference can be used to enhance the robustness, fairness, and interpretability of NLP models.

**Unified Overview**: By providing a unified overview, the paper aims to guide the NLP community in understanding and applying causal inference to their work.

The paper has been accepted to Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL) and offers a significant contribution to the field by bridging the gap between causality and NLP¹.
